*   **Database Connectivity:** JDBC (SQLite JDBC Driver)
*   **Date/Time API:** `java.time` (LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime)

## 4. Database Schema
The application uses an SQLite database named `identifier.sqlite`. The schema consists of the following tables:

*   **`users`**: Stores user information (ID, username, password, role).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        password TEXT NOT NULL,
        role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(role IN ('student', 'professor'))
    );
    ```
*   **`appointments`**: Stores appointment details (ID, student ID, professor ID, time, status).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE appointments (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        student_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        professor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        appointment_time TEXT NOT NULL, -- ISO-8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
        status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, approved, rejected
        FOREIGN KEY(student_id) REFERENCES users(id),
        FOREIGN KEY(professor_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```
*   **`availability`**: Stores professor availability slots (ID, professor ID, time).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE availability (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        professor_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        available_time TEXT NOT NULL, -- ISO-8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
        FOREIGN KEY(professor_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```
*   **`notifications`**: Stores notifications for users (ID, user ID, message, read status).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE notifications (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        message TEXT NOT NULL,
        is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- 0 (okunmadÄ±), 1 (okundu)
        -- IMPORTANT: The Java code (NotificationDAO, Notification.java) expects a 'timestamp' column.
        -- Add it to your schema for full functionality (see Setup instructions below):
        -- timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 
        FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```
*   **`messages`**: Stores messages between users (ID, sender ID, receiver ID, content, timestamp).
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE messages (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        receiver_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        content TEXT NOT NULL,
        timestamp TEXT NOT NULL, -- ISO-8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
        FOREIGN KEY(sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),
        FOREIGN KEY(receiver_id) REFERENCES users(id)
    );
    ```

## 5. Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or newer.
2.  **SQLite JDBC Driver:** This is typically managed by your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) if you add it as a library. If running manually, ensure `sqlite-jdbc.jar` is in your classpath.
3.  **SQLite Database Browser (Optional):** Tools like "DB Browser for SQLite" can be helpful for inspecting the database.

### Steps
1.  **Clone or Download the Project:** Get all the `.java` files.
2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   The `DatabaseConnection.java` class attempts to connect to/create an SQLite database file at a **hardcoded path**: `C:/Users/Oguzhan/IdeaProjects/AcademicAppointmentSystem/identifier.sqlite`.
        *   **You MUST either create this directory structure OR modify the path in `DatabaseConnection.java` to a suitable location on your system.** A relative path like `jdbc:sqlite:identifier.sqlite` is recommended to create the database file in the project's root directory.
    *   When the application runs for the first time and `DatabaseConnection.getConnection()` is called, the `identifier.sqlite` file will be created if it doesn't exist at the specified path.
    *   **Create Tables:** Open the newly created (or existing) `identifier.sqlite` file with an SQLite browser or command-line tool. Execute the SQL statements provided in the "Database Schema" section (Section 4) to create the necessary tables.
        *   **Crucial Modification for `notifications` table:** As noted in the schema and comments in `NotificationDAO.java`, the `notifications` table in the provided SQL schema is missing a `timestamp` column which the Java code expects. You **must** add this column for the notification feature to work correctly.
          You can either:
          *   Modify the `CREATE TABLE notifications` statement before running it:
            ```sql
            CREATE TABLE notifications (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                message TEXT NOT NULL,
                is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
                timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- ADDED LINE
                FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
            );
            ```
          *   Or, if the table is already created without it, use `ALTER TABLE`:
            ```sql
            ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
            ```

3.  **Compile the Java Files:**
    *   **Using an IDE (Recommended):**
        *   Create a new Java project in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
        *   Add all the `.java` files to your project's `src` directory.
        *   Ensure the SQLite JDBC driver is added to the project's libraries/dependencies.
        *   The IDE will typically compile the files automatically.
    *   **Using Command Line:**
        *   Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` files.
        *   Compile: `javac *.java` (assuming all files are in the same directory and the JDBC driver is in the classpath).

4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   **Main Class:** `AcademicAppointmentSystem.java`
    *   Run this class from your IDE or using the command line: `java AcademicAppointmentSystem` (ensure the JDBC driver is in the classpath if running from command line).

5.  **Create Initial Users (Important):**
    The system does not have a built-in registration feature. You need to manually add users (at least one student and one professor) to the `users` table using an SQLite tool *after* creating the tables.
    Example:
    ```sql
    -- Add a professor
    INSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES ('prof_smith', 'pass123', 'professor');
    -- Add a student
    INSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES ('student_john', 'pass123', 'student');
    ```
    **Note:** Passwords are currently stored as plain text. This is a security risk for real applications.

## 7. How to Use

1.  **Start the Application:** Run `AcademicAppointmentSystem.java`.
2.  **Select Role:** Choose "Student" or "Professor".
3.  **Login:** Enter the credentials of a user you previously inserted into the database.
    *   If login is successful, the respective dashboard (Student or Professor) will open.

### Student Workflow
1.  **Schedule Appointment:**
    *   Click "Schedule New Appointment".
    *   Select a professor, enter a date (YYYY-MM-DD), and click "View Slots".
    *   Select an available time slot and click "Schedule".
2.  **View Appointments:**
    *   Click "View My Appointments" to see appointment statuses and cancel pending ones.
3.  **Check Notifications/Messages:**
    *   Use "View Notifications" and "View My Messages".
    *   Use "Send Message to Professor" to communicate.

### Professor Workflow
1.  **Manage Availability:**
    *   Click "Manage My Availability".
    *   Enter a date, click "View/Refresh Date" to see existing slots for that date.
    *   Select a time from the dropdown and click "Add Slot".
    *   Select an existing slot from the list and click "Delete Selected Slot".
2.  **Manage Appointments:**
    *   Click "View/Manage Appointment Requests".
    *   Approve or Reject pending requests using the buttons in the table.
3.  **Check Notifications/Messages:**
    *   Use "View Notifications" and "View Messages".
    *   Use "Send New Message" to communicate with individual students or broadcast to all.

## 8. Troubleshooting & Known Issues

*   **Database Path:** The database path in `DatabaseConnection.java` is hardcoded. You **must** adjust this path or ensure the specified directory structure exists for the application to work. Using a relative path (e.g., `jdbc:sqlite:identifier.sqlite`) is highly recommended for portability.
*   **Missing `timestamp` Column in `notifications` Table:** The provided SQL schema for the `notifications` table does **not** include a `timestamp` column. However, `NotificationDAO.java` and `Notification.java` expect this column for querying, sorting, and display.
    *   **Solution:** You **must** add a `timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` column to your `notifications` table schema (see Section 5.2 "Database Setup" for instructions). Failure to do so will likely result in SQL errors when accessing notifications (e.g., "no such column: timestamp").
*   **Plain Text Passwords:** Passwords are stored in plain text in the database (as noted in `UserDAO.addUser`). This is a significant security vulnerability in a production system. Passwords should be hashed.
*   **No Registration:** Users cannot register through the application. They must be added manually to the `users` table in the SQLite database.
*   **Error Handling:** While some error handling exists (e.g., for unique username constraints during user addition, some input validations), it could be made more comprehensive and user-friendly across the application.
*   **UI Rigidity:** The use of `setLayout(null)` (absolute positioning) makes the UI rigid and not responsive to window resizing or different screen resolutions. Using layout managers (e.g., `BorderLayout`, `FlowLayout`, `GridBagLayout`, `GroupLayout`) is generally preferred for more robust GUIs.

## 9. Potential Future Enhancements
*   Implement password hashing (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).
*   Add a user registration feature.
*   Use a relative path for the database file by default or make it configurable via a properties file.
*   Refactor UI to use standard Java Swing layout managers for better responsiveness.
*   Implement more detailed logging for debugging and auditing.
*   Add email or real-time in-app indicators for new notifications/messages.
*   Create a proper `DatabaseSchemaManager` class to initialize or migrate the database schema automatically on application startup.
*   Write unit and integration tests for DAOs and business logic.
*   Improve date and time input with JDatePicker or similar calendar components.
